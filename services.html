        <p>OCMii  combines my knowledge of the Irish Innovation landscape <br> and my strong desire to export it to the Caribbean Markets. OCMii aims<br> to be a trusted 
        bridge and a channel for economic partnerships between the Caribbean <br>market and the Irish Enterprises and Innovation network. OCMii also has strong ambitions 
        o facilitate<br> on going cooperation between the all the Caribbean <br>Nations and the EU through Martinique and Guadeloupe which have a native visibility and access 
        into EU's top Industry, knowhow, Innovation and <br>projects thanks to existing  economic, political and financial, policies and agreements.</p>

    <div id="second-para">
        <p>
            It is critical for the Caribbean nations to be active participants in the fourth <br>
            industrial revolution (new technologies). Innovation is paramount for maintaining <br>
            competitiveness in a Global Market especially for small countries.The Caribbean region <br>
            in general suffers from the emigration of its talent, which is a hindrance to <br>
            progress and a disaster when there is no indigenous replacement.Even when the <br>
            desire to come back is strong, our emigrated elite is reluctant to return home, for <br>
            lack of the comparable work and life conditions which they are accustomedto. Providing <br>
            cutting-edge innovation and projects would allow the Caribbean a to be key international player through:<br>
            •	The retention of our talent by creating and maintaining high-value jobs<br>
            •	Developing and nurturing businesses, scientists and talented people.<br>
            •	Attracting back to our shores our elite currently based in America, Africa, Europe, and Asia.  <br>

        <p>
            I have the unshakable belief that the Caribbean is a market that international <br>
            businesses will have to contend with. From Cuba to Puerto Rico and from the Bahamas<br>
            to Trinidad & Tobago, a myriad of business opportunities await partners with vision.<br>
            Born and raised in Martinique (French outermost region). I possess the indigenous desire<br>
            to participate in the transformation of the Caribbean from a tourism dependant zone to a<br>
            major economic player. For the past 20 years I have lived and worked in Ireland in a highly<br>
            advanced technological field within the very competitive sector of Higher Education<br>
            Institutes (HEI). OCMii (Opening the Caribbean Market to Investment and innovation) <br>
            taps into the important “HEI - Irish Industry” synergy, which has been responsible for<br>
            the creation of successful international companies and start-ups. This synergy has been<br>
            the main contributor to the establishment of Ireland as a global leader of Innovation.<br>
            OCMii aims to become the perfect Innovation gateway into the Caribbean.
