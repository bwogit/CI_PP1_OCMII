                <h3><strong>The Bio</strong></h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                I have the unshakable belief that the Caribbean is a market that international 
                businesses will have to contend with. From Cuba to Puerto Rico and from the 
                Bahamas to Trinidad & Tobago, a myriad of business opportunities await 
                partners with vision. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Born and raised in Martinique (French outermost region). I possess the indigenous desire to 
                participate in the transformation of the Caribbean from a tourism dependant zone to a 
                major economic player.  
                </p>
                <br>
                                
                For the past 20 years I have lived and worked in Ireland in a highly advanced 
                technological field within the very competitive sector of Higher Education Institutes (HEI). 
                OCMii (<strong>Opening</strong> the <strong>Caribbean Market</strong> to <strong>investment & innovation</strong> ) taps 
                into the important “HEI - Irish Industry” synergy, which has been responsible for 
                the creation of successful international companies and start-ups. 
                This synergy has been the main contributor to the establishment of Ireland as a 
                global leader of Innovation. OCMii aims to become the perfect Innovation gateway 
                into the Caribbean.

        <h3>The Vision</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Caribbean region
            in general suffers from the emigration of its talent, which is a hindrance to  
            progress and a disaster when there is no indigenous replacement.Even when the  
            desire to come back is strong, our emigrated elite is reluctant to return home, for 
            lack of the comparable work and life conditions which they are accustomed to. Providing 
            cutting-edge innovation and projects would allow the Caribbean a to be key international 
            player through:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The retention of our talent by creating and maintaining high-value jobs</li>
               
                <li>Developing and nurturing businesses, scientists and talented people.</li>
              
                <li>Attracting back to our shores our elite currently based in America, Africa, Europe, and Asia.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>
                It is critical for the Caribbean nations to be active participants in the fourth
                industrial revolution (new technologies). Innovation is paramount for maintaining
                competitiveness in a Global Market especially for small countries. 
                All over the world, digitization and the digital economy has enabled businesses to 
                increase productivity and spur innovation. In recognition of this fact, developed country 
                governments are making digital economy policy a top priority, working to empower their 
                businesses and citizens with the tools, education and resources necessary to reap the full 
                benefits of the digital economy.

        <h3>Bridging Europe and the Caribbean </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        OCMii  combines my knowledge of the Irish Innovation landscape and my strong desire to export it to the 
        Caribbean Markets. OCMii aims to be a trusted bridge and a channel for economic partnerships between the 
        Caribbean market and the Irish Enterprises and Innovation network. OCMii also has strong ambitions to facilitate 
        on going cooperation between the all the Caribbean Nations and the EU through Martinique and Guadeloupe which 
        have a native visibility and access into EU top Industry, knowhow, Innovation and projects thanks to 
        existing  economic, political and financial, policies and agreements.
        <br>
        <br>
        OCMii capitalises on synergies between Enterprise Ireland and HEIs in Ireland. 
        OCMii joined the TEAM (Trade Enterprise and Marketing) Open Innovation Network in the Institute of Technology 
        Carlow in July 2021 as part of its ongoing development as an innovation broker focused on the opportunities 
        for international trade with the Caribbean region.
        
        
        TEAM Open Innovation Network is an Enterprise Ireland supported initiative to connect regional ambition with 
        international engagement and enterprise development, through a variety of enterprise and entrepreneurship 
        development initiatives.
       
        <br><br>
        The TEAM Open Innovation Network gives OCMII access to the Irish HEIs and Enterprise Development 
        Infrastructure both of which have strong international focus and accessibility.
        
        <!-- <br>
        TEAM is using a codesign process in association with its clients to develop bespoke enterprise 
        development and business development agendas. 
        
        <br>
        These Education-Industry synergies create innovation and are the ideal medium for the transfer of 
        technologies into industry via spin-off companies. The Mission of OCMii is thus to seek innovation opportunities 
        and create business synergies between Ireland and the Caribbean through:
        <br>
        


        OCMII and TEAM will collaborate across education, research, and enterprise development plans with projects 
        which can connect with Caribbean ambitions. OCMii will also engage with individuals and organisations from 
        both a private and public perspective.
        To date OCMII and TEAM have identified some potential opportunities in education, aquaculture, agriculture, 
        technology and creative industries which we are exploring and planning to expand to next level of engagement.
